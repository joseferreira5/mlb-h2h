#### MVP

The homepage will have a single text input field where the user can enter a players last name, check whether the player is active in the league, and click the search button. If only one player exists, then that player will be saved as the first player to compare, and their name and photo will appear on the left side of the page. If there are multiple players with the same last name, a list will appear and the user can select the specific player. One or both players can be removed from the screen and the user can search for a different player. Once both players are selected, the user can hit the compare button which will take them to the comparison page. Both of the players stats will be displayed side by side.

#### Post-MVP

- Debounce the search input so that PlayerList is rendered as user enters name.
- Page transitions and component animations using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).
- Leaderboard bar displayed at the top of the homepage - shows current leaders in popular stats
- The ability to compare more players more players based on screen size.
